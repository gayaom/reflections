When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
First thing is, its a good way to keep back up of my files. Most frequently I use this when I collaborate with other people on a project.
I also use them when I want to share my code with someone by making it public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I am working on a code, it is better if I update my local repository rather than automatically happening. Sometimes I am not sure about code I am working on and dont want to mess my local code as well.
