When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
First thing is, its a good way to keep back up of my files. Most frequently I use this when I collaborate with other people on a project.
I also use them when I want to share my code with someone by making it public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I am working on a code, it is better if I update my local repository rather than automatically happening. Sometimes I am not sure about code I am working on and dont want to mess my local code as well.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 Branches: Branches happen on a single repository. We use branches when we want to try out a new experimental feature that you are still not sure will work but still want to have a working demo to show what you are working on.
Clones: Clones work on any two repositories. Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one just like it. The original repository could be either remote or local.
Forks: Forking is only used within the context of GitHub, taking an existing GitHub repository and making a copy of it.
