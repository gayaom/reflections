When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
First thing is, its a good way to keep back up of my files. Most frequently I use this when I collaborate with other people on a project.
I also use them when I want to share my code with someone by making it public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If I am working on a code, it is better if I update my local repository rather than automatically happening. Sometimes I am not sure about code I am working on and dont want to mess my local code as well.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 Branches: Branches happen on a single repository. We use branches when we want to try out a new experimental feature that you are still not sure will work but still want to have a working demo to show what you are working on.
Clones: Clones work on any two repositories. Cloning involves taking an existing repository and making one just like it. The original repository could be either remote or local.
Forks: Forking is only used within the context of GitHub, taking an existing GitHub repository and making a copy of it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
It enables us to keep the state of remote in your hand while working  in your local machine especially when offline. Getting everything up-to-date can be done first by merging your local copy with local remote and then second is push the changes to github.
